           Destroying  a file system requires traversing all of its data in order to return its used space to the pool. Without async_destroy
           the file system is not fully removed until all space has been reclaimed. If the destroy operation is interrupted by  a  reboot  or

           When  async_destroy is enabled the file system\'s data will be reclaimed by a background process, allowing the destroy operation to
           complete without traversing the entire file system. The background process is able to resume interrupted destroys after  the  pool

           lz4 is a high-performance real-time compression algorithm that features significantly faster compression and decompression as well
           as a higher compression ratio than the older lzjb compression.  Typically, lz4 compression is approximately  50%  faster  on  compressible
		   data and 200% faster on incompressible data than lzjb. It is also approximately 80% faster on decompression, while giving
		   approximately 10% better compression ratio.

           When the lz4_compress feature is set to enabled, the administrator can turn on lz4 compression on any dataset on  the  pool  using
           the  zfs(8)  command.  Please  note  that doing so will immediately activate the lz4_compress feature on the underlying pool (even
           before any data is written). Since this feature is not read-only compatible, this operation will render the pool  unimportable  on

           This features allows ZFS to maintain more information about how free space is organized within the  pool.  If
           this  feature  is  enabled,  ZFS will set this feature to active when a new space map object is created or an

           This  feature  improves  performance  of incremental sends ("zfs send -i") and receives for objects with many
           holes. The most common case of hole-filled objects is zvols.

           An incremental send stream from snapshot A to snapshot B contains information about every block that  changed
           between  A  and B. Blocks which did not change between those snapshots can be identified and omitted from the
           stream using a piece of metadata called the ’block birth time’, but birth times are not  recorded  for  holes
           (blocks  filled  only  with  zeroes).  Since holes created after A cannot be distinguished from holes created
           before A, information about every hole in the entire filesystem or zvol is included in the send stream.

           For workloads where holes are rare this is not a problem. However, when incrementally replicating filesystems
           or  zvols  with many holes (for example a zvol formatted with another filesystem) a lot of time will be spent
           sending and receiving unnecessary information about holes that already exist on the receiving side.

           Once the hole_birth feature has been enabled the block birth times of all new holes will be recorded.  Incre-
           mental  sends  between  snapshots  created  after this feature is enabled will use this new metadata to avoid
           sending information about holes that already exist on the receiving side.

           This feature becomes active as soon as it is enabled and will never return to being enabled.',

		'feature@embedded_data' => 'GUID                   com.delphix:embedded_data

           This feature improves the performance and compression ratio of highly-compressible blocks.  Blocks whose con-
           tents can compress to 112 bytes or smaller can take advantage of this feature.

           When  this  feature  is enabled, the contents of highly-compressible blocks are stored in the block "pointer"
           itself (a misnomer in this case, as it contains the compresseed data, rather than a pointer to  its  location
           on  disk).   Thus the space of the block (one sector, typically 512 bytes or 4KB) is saved, and no additional
           i/o is needed to read and write the data block.

           This feature becomes active as soon as it is enabled and will never return to being enabled.',

           The large_block feature allows the record size on a dataset to be set larger than 128KB.

           This feature becomes active once a recordsize property has been set larger than 128KB, and will return to being enabled once all
           filesystems that have ever had their recordsize larger than 128KB are destroyed.',

           This  feature  enables filesystem and snapshot limits. These limits can be used to control how many filesystems and/or snapshots
           can be created at the point in the tree on which the limits are set.

             * Samba must be able to authenticate a user. This can be done in a number of ways, depending
             on if using the system password file, LDAP or the Samba specific smbpasswd file. How to do

	   <h4>Zones</h4>
	   A  ZFS file system can be added to a non-global zone by using zonecfg\'\s
       "add fs" subcommand. A ZFS file system that is added  to  a  non-global
       zone must have its mountpoint property set to legacy.

       The  physical  properties of an added file system are controlled by the
       global administrator. However, the zone administrator can create,  mod-
       ify,  or  destroy  files within the added file system, depending on how
       the file system is mounted.

       A dataset can also be delegated to a non-global zone by using zonecfg\'\s
       "add dataset" subcommand. You cannot delegate a dataset to one zone and
       the children of the same dataset to another zone. The zone  administra-
       tor  can  change properties of the dataset or any of its children. How-
       ever, the "quota" property is controlled by the global administrator.

       A ZFS volume can be added as a device to a  non-global  zone  by  using
       zonecfg\'\s "add device" subcommand. However, its physical properties can
       only be modified by the global administrator.

       For more information about zonecfg syntax, see zonecfg(1M).

       After a dataset is delegated to a non-global zone, the "zoned" property
       is  automatically  set.	A  zoned  file system cannot be mounted in the
       global zone, since the zone administrator might have to set  the  mount
       point to an unacceptable value.

       The  global  administrator  can	forcibly  clear  the "zoned" property,
       though this should be done with extreme care. The global  administrator
       should  verify that all the mount points are acceptable before clearing
       the property.');
