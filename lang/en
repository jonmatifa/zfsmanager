promote_cmd=zfs promote <u>clone-filesystem</u>
promote_desc=Promotes a clone file system to no longer be dependent on its "origin" snapshot. This makes it possible to destroy the file system that the clone was created from. The clone parent-child dependency relationship is reversed, so that the origin file system becomes a clone of the specified file system. <br /><br /> The snapshot that was cloned, and any snapshots previous to this snapshot, are now owned by the promoted clone. The space they use moves from the origin file system to the promoted clone, so enough space must be available to accommodate these snapshots. No new space is consumed by this operation, but the space accounting is adjusted. The promoted clone must not have any conflicting snapshot names of its own. The rename subcommand can be used to rename any conflicting snapshots.

clone_cmd=zfs clone [-p] [-o <u>property</u>=<u>value</u>] ... snapshot <u>filesystem</u>|<u>volume</u>
clone_desc=Creates a clone of the given snapshot. See the "Clones" section for details. The target dataset can be located anywhere in the ZFS hierarchy, and is created as the same type as the original.<br /><br />-p<br />Creates all the non-existing parent datasets. Datasets created in this manner are automatically mounted according to the mountpoint property inherited from their parent. If the target  filesystem  or  volume  already exists, the operation completes successfully.<br /><br />-o <u>property</u>=<u>value</u><br /> Sets the specified property; see zfs create for details.

export_cmd=zpool export [-a] [-f] <u>pool</u> ...
export_desc=Exports the given pools from the system. All devices are marked as exported, but are still considered in use by other subsystems. The devices can be moved between systems (even those of different endianness) and imported as long as a sufficient number of devices are present.<br /><br />Before exporting the pool, all datasets within the pool are unmounted. A pool can not be exported if it has a shared spare that is currently being used.<br /><br />For pools to be portable, you must give the zpool command whole disks, not just partitions, so that ZFS can label the disks with portable EFI labels. Otherwise, disk drivers on platforms of different endianness will not recognize the disks.<br /><br />-a    Exports all pools imported on the system.<br /><br />-f    Forcefully unmount all datasets, using the "unmount -f" command. <br /><br />This command will forcefully export the pool even if it has a shared spare that is currently being used. This may lead to potential data corruption.<br /><br />

#zfs property descriptions
prop_aclinherit=Controls how ACL entries are inherited when files and directories are created. A file system with an "aclinherit" property of "discard" does not inherit any ACL entries. A file system with an "aclinherit" property value of "noallow" only inherits inheritable ACL entries that specify "deny" permissions. The property value "restricted" (the default) removes the "write_acl" and "write_owner" permissions when the ACL entry is inherited. A file system with an "aclinherit" property value of "passthrough" inherits all inheritable ACL entries without any modifications made to the ACL entries when they are inherited. A file system with an "aclinherit" property value of "passthrough-x" has the same meaning as "passthrough", except that the owner@, group@, and everyone@ ACEs inherit the execute permission only if the file creation mode also requests the execute bit. When the property value is set to "passthrough," files are created with a mode determined by the inheritable ACEs. If no inheritable ACEs exist that affect the mode, then the mode is set in accordance to the requested mode from the application.
prop_aclmode=Controls how an ACL is modified during chmod(2). A file system with an "aclmode" property of "discard" deletes all ACL entries that do not represent the mode  of  the  file.  An  "aclmode"  property  of "groupmask"  (the  default)  reduces user or group permissions. The permissions are reduced, such that they are  no  greater  than  the group  permission bits, unless it is a user entry that has the same UID as the owner of the file or directory. In this  case,  the  ACL permissions are reduced so that they are no greater than owner permission  bits.  A  file  system  with  an  "aclmode"  property   of "passthrough"  indicates  that no changes are made to the ACL other than generating the necessary ACL entries to represent the new mode of the file or directory.
prop_acltype=Controls whether ACLs are enabled and if so what type of ACL to use. When a file system has the acltype property set to noacl (the default) then ACLs are disabled. Setting the acltype property to posixacl indicates Posix ACLs should be used. Posix ACLs are specific to Linux and are not functional on other platforms. Posix ACLs are stored as an xattr and therefore will not overwrite any existing ZFS/NFSv4 ACLs which may be set. Currently only posixacls are supported on Linux.<br /><br />To obtain the best performance when setting posixacl users are strongly encouraged to set the xattr=sa property. This will result in the Posix ACL being stored more efficiently on disk. But as a consequence of this all new xattrs will only be accessable from ZFS implementations which support the xattr=sa property. See the xattr property for more details.
prop_atime=Controls whether the access time for files is updated when they are read. Turning this property off avoids producing write traffic when reading files and can result in significant performance gains, though it might confuse mailers and other similar utilities. The default value is "on".
prop_available=The amount of space available to the dataset and all its children, assuming that there is no other activity in the pool. Because space is shared within a pool, availability can be limited by any number of factors, including physical pool size, quotas, reservations, or other datasets within the pool. This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, "avail".
prop_canmount=If this property is set to "off", the file system cannot be mounted, and is ignored by "zfs mount -a". Setting this property to "off" is similar to setting the "mountpoint" property to "none", except that the dataset still has a normal "mountpoint" property, which can be inherited. Setting this property to "off" allows datasets to be used solely as a mechanism to inherit properties. One example of setting canmount=off is to have two datasets with the same mountpoint, so that the children of both datasets	appear in the same directory, but might have different inherited characteristics.<br /><br />When the "noauto" option is set, a dataset can only be mounted and unmounted explicitly. The dataset is not mounted automatically when the dataset is created or imported, nor is it mounted by the "zfs mount -a" command or unmounted by the "zfs unmount -a" command.<br /><br />This property is not inherited.
prop_casesensitivity=Indicates whether the file name matching algorithm used by the file system should be case-sensitive, case-insensitive, or allow a combination of both styles of matching. The default value for the casesensitivity property is sensitive. Traditionally, UNIX and POSIX file systems have case-sensitive file names.<br /><br />The mixed value for the casesensitivity property indicates that the file system can support requests for both case-sensitive and case-insensitive matching behavior. Currently, case-insensitive matching behavior on a file system that supports mixed behavior is limited to the Solaris CIFS server product. For more information about the mixed value behavior, see the Solaris ZFS Administration Guide.
prop_checksum=Controls the checksum used to verify data integrity. The default value is "on", which automatically selects an appropriate algorithm (currently, fletcher2, but this may change in future releases). The value "off" disables integrity checking on user data. Disabling checksums is NOT a recommended practice.
prop_clones=A clone is a writable volume or file system whose initial contents are the same as another dataset. As with snapshots, creating a clone is nearly instantaneous, and initially consumes no additional space. Clones can only be created from a snapshot. When a snapshot is cloned, it creates an implicit dependency between the parent and child. Even though the clone is created somewhere else in the dataset hierarchy, the original snapshot cannot be destroyed as long as a clone exists. The origin property exposes this dependency, and the destroy command lists any such dependencies, if they exist.<br /><br /> The clone parent-child dependency relationship can be reversed by using the promote subcommand. This causes the "origin" file system to become a clone of the specified file system, which makes it possible to destroy the file system that the clone was created from.
prop_com.sun:auto-snapshot=zfs-auto-snapshot automatically creates, rotates, and destroys snapshots for all your ZFS datasets, and is compatible with both zfsonlinux and zfs-fuse. 
prop_compression=Controls the compression algorithm used for this dataset. The "lzjb" compression algorithm is optimized for performance while providing decent data compression. Setting compression to "on" uses the "lzjb" compression algorithm. The "gzip" compression algorithm uses the same compression as the gzip(1) command. You can specify the "gzip" level by using the value "gzip-N" where N is an integer from 1 (fastest) to 9 (best compression ratio). Currently, "gzip" is equivalent to "gzip-6" (which is also the default for gzip(1)). This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name "compress".
prop_compressratio=The compression ratio achieved for this dataset, expressed as a multiplier. Compression can be turned on by running "zfs set compression=on dataset". The default value is "off".
prop_context=This flag sets the SELinux context for all files in the filesytem under the mountpoint for that filesystem. See selinux(8) for more information.
prop_copies=Controls the number of copies of data stored for this dataset. These copies are in addition to any redundancy provided by the pool, for example, mirroring or raid-z. The copies are stored on different disks, if possible. The space used by multiple copies is charged to the associated file and dataset, changing the "used" property and counting against quotas and reservations.<br /><br /> Changing this property only affects newly-written data. Therefore, set this property at file system creation time by using the "-o copies=" option.
prop_creation=The time this dataset was created.
prop_dedup=Configures deduplication for a dataset. The default value is off. The default deduplication checksum is sha256 (this may change in the future). When dedup is enabled, the checksum defined here overrides the checksum property. Setting the value to verify has the same effect as the setting sha256,verify. If set to verify, ZFS will do a byte-to-byte comparsion in case of two blocks having the same signature to make sure the block contents are identical.
prop_defcontext=This flag sets the SELinux context for unlabeled files.  See selinux(8) for more information.
prop_devices=Controls  whether  device  nodes can be opened on this file system. The default value is "on".
prop_exec=Controls whether processes can be executed from  within  this  file system. The default value is "on".
prop_filesystem_count=The total number of filesystems and volumes that exist under this location in the dataset tree. This value is only available when a filesystem_limit has been set somewhere in the tree under which the dataset resides.
prop_filesystem_limit=Limits the number of filesystems and volumes that can exist under this point in the dataset tree. The limit is not enforced if the user is allowed to change the limit. Setting a filesystem_limit on a descendent of a filesystem that already has a filesystem_limit does not override the ancestor\'s filesystem_limit, but rather imposes an additional limit. This feature must be enabled to be used (see zpool-features(5)).
prop_fscontext=This flag sets the SELinux context for the filesytem being mounted. See selinux(8) for more information.
prop_logbias=Provide a hint to ZFS about handling of synchronous requests in this dataset. If logbias is set to latency (the default), ZFS will use pool log devices (if configured) to handle the requests at low latency. If logbias is set to throughput, ZFS will not use configured pool log devices. ZFS will instead optimize synchronous operations for global pool throughput and efficient use of resources.
prop_logicalused=The amount of space that is "logically" accessible by this dataset. See the referenced property. The logical space ignores the effect of the compression and copies properties, giving a quantity closer to the amount of data that applications see. However, it does include space consumed by metadata.<br /><br /> This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, lrefer.
prop_logicalreferenced=The amount of space that is "logically" accessible by this dataset. See the referenced property. The logical space ignores the effect of the compression and copies properties, giving a quantity closer to the amount of data that applications see. However, it does include space consumed by metadata.<br /><br />This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, lrefer.
prop_mslabel=The mlslabel property is a sensitivity label that determines if a dataset  can be mounted in a zone on a system with Trusted Extensions enabled. If the labeled dataset matches the labeled zone, the dataset can be mounted and accessed from the labeled zone.<br /><br />When the mlslabel property is not set, the default value is none. Setting the mlslabel property to none is equivalent to removing the property.<br /><br />The mlslabel property can be modified only when Trusted Extensions is enabled and only with appropriate privilege. Rights to modify it cannot be delegated. When changing a label to a higher label or setting the initial dataset label, the {PRIV_FILE_UPGRADE_SL} privilege is required. When changing a label to a lower label or the default (none), the {PRIV_FILE_DOWNGRADE_SL} privilege is required. Changing the dataset to labels other than the default can be done only when the dataset is not mounted. When a dataset with the default label is mounted into a labeled-zone, the mount operation automatically sets the mlslabel property to the label of that zone.<br /><br /> When Trusted Extensions is not enabled, only datasets with the default label (none) can be mounted.<br /><br /> Zones are a Solaris feature and are not relevant on Linux.
prop_mounted=For file systems, indicates whether the file system is currently mounted. This property can be either yes or no.
prop_mountpoint=Controls the mount point used for this file system. See the "Mount Points" section for more information on how this property is used.<br /><br />When the mountpoint property is changed for a file system, the file system and any children that inherit the mount point are unmounted. If the new value is legacy, then they remain unmounted. Otherwise, they are automatically remounted in the new location if the property was previously legacy or none, or if they were mounted before the property was changed. In addition, any shared file systems are unshared and shared in the new location.
prop_recordsize=Specifies a suggested block size for files in the file system. This property is designed solely for use with  database  workloads  that access  files  in fixed-size records. ZFS automatically tunes block sizes according to internal algorithms optimized for typical access patterns. For databases that create very large files but access them in small random chunks, these algorithms may be suboptimal. Specifying a "recordsize" greater than or equal to the record size of the database can result in significant performance gains. Use of this property for general purpose file systems is strongly discouraged, and may adversely affect performance. The size specified must be a power of two greater than or equal to 512 and less than or equal to 128 Kbytes. Changing the file system\'\s recordsize only affects files created afterward; existing files are unaffected. This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, "recsize".
prop_readonly=Controls whether this dataset can be modified. The default value is "off".<br /> This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, "rdonly".
prop_realtime=Controls the manner in which the access time is updated when atime=on is set. Turning this property on causes the access time to be updated relative to the modify or change time. Access time is only updated if the previous access time was earlier than the current modify or change time or if the existing access time hasn’t been updated within the past 24 hours. The default value is off.
prop_redundant_metadata=Controls what types of metadata are stored redundantly. ZFS stores an extra copy of metadata, so that if a single block is corrupted, the amount of user data lost is limited. This extra copy is in addition to any redundancy provided at the pool level (e.g. by mirroring or RAID-Z), and is in addition to an extra copy specified by the copies property (up to a total of 3 copies). For example if the pool is mirrored, copies=2, and redundant_metadata=most, then ZFS stores 6 copies of most metadata, and 4 copies of data and some metadata.<br /><br />When set to all, ZFS stores an extra copy of all metadata. If a single on-disk block is corrupt, at worst a single block of user data (which is recordsize bytes long) can be lost.<br /><br />When set to most, ZFS stores an extra copy of most types of metadata. This can improve performance of random writes, because less metadata must be written. In practice, at worst about 100 blocks (of recordsize bytes each) of user data can be lost if a single on-disk block is corrupt. The exact behavior of which metadata blocks are stored redundantly may change in future releases.<br /><br />The default value is all.
prop_refcompressratio=The compression ratio achieved for the referenced space of this dataset, expressed as a multiplier. See also the compressratio property.
prop_quota=Limits the amount of space a dataset and its descendents can consume. This property enforces a hard limit on the  amount  of  space used. This includes all space consumed by descendents, including file systems and snapshots. Setting a quota on a descendent of a dataset that already has a quota does not override the ancestor's quota, but rather imposes an additional limit. <br /><br />Quotas cannot be set on volumes, as the "volsize" property acts as an implicit quota.

#zpool property descriptions
prop_allocated=Amount of storage space within the pool that has been physically allocated.
prop_altroot=Alternate root directory. If set, this directory is prepended to any mount points within the pool. This can be used when examining an unknown pool where the mount points cannot be trusted, or in an alternate boot environment, where the typical paths are not valid. altroot is not a persistent property. It is valid only while the system is up. Setting altroot defaults to using cachefile=none, though this may be overridden using an explicit setting.
prop_ashift=Pool sector size exponent, to the power of 2 (internally referred to as "ashift"). I/O operations will be aligned to the specified size boundaries. Additionally, the minimum (disk) write size will be set to the specified size, so this represents a space vs. performance trade-off. The typical case for setting this property is when performance is important and the underlying disks use 4KiB sectors but report 512B sectors to the OS (for compatibility reasons); in that case, set ashift=12 (which is 1<<12 = 4096). For optimal performance, the pool sector size should be greater than or equal to the sector size of the underlying disks. Since the property cannot be changed after pool creation, if in a given pool, you ever want to use drives that report 4KiB sectors, you must set ashift=12 at pool creation time.
prop_autoexpand=Controls automatic pool expansion when the underlying LUN is grown. If set to "on", the pool will be resized according to the size of the expanded device. If the device is part of a mirror or raidz then all devices within that mirror/raidz group must be expanded before the new space is made available to the pool. The default behavior is "off". This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, expand.
prop_autoreplace=Controls automatic device replacement. If set to "off", device replacement must be initiated by the administrator by using the "zpool replace" command. If set to "on", any new device, found in the same physical location as a device that previously belonged to the pool, is automatically formatted and replaced. The default behavior is "off". This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, "replace".
prop_autotrim=When set to on space which has been recently freed, and is no longer allocated by the pool, will be periodically trimmed.  This allows block device vdevs which support BLKDISCARD, such as SSDs, or file vdevs on which the underlying file system supports hole-punching, to reclaim unused blocks.  The default setting for this property is off.<br /> Automatic TRIM does not immediately reclaim blocks after a free. Instead, it will optimistically delay allowing smaller ranges to be aggregated in to a few larger ones.  These can then be issued more efficiently to the storage.  TRIM on L2ARC devices is enabled by setting l2arc_trim_ahead > 0.<br /> Be aware that automatic trimming of recently freed data blocks can put significant stress on the underlying storage devices.  This will vary depending of how well the specific device handles these commands.  For lower end devices it is often possible to achieve most of the benefits of automatic trimming by running an on-demand (manual) TRIM periodically using the zpool trim command.
prop_bootfs=Identifies the default bootable dataset for the root pool. This property is expected to be set mainly by the installation and upgrade programs.
prop_cachefile=Controls the location of where the pool configuration is cached. Discovering all pools on system startup requires a cached copy of the configuration data that is stored on the root file system. All pools in this cache are automatically imported when the system boots. Some environments, such as install and clustering, need to cache this information in a different location so that pools are not automatically imported. Setting this property caches the pool configuration in a different location that can later be imported with "zpool import -c". Setting it to the special value "none" creates a temporary pool that is never cached, and the special value '' (empty string) uses the default location.
prop_capacity=Percentage of pool space used. This property can also be referred to by its shortened column name, "cap".
prop_comment=A text string consisting of printable ASCII characters that will be stored such that it is available even if the pool becomes faulted. An administrator can provide additional information about a pool using this property.
prop_dedupratio=The deduplication ratio specified for a pool, expressed as a multiplier.  For example, a dedupratio value of 1.76 indicates that 1.76 units of data were stored but only 1 unit of disk space was actually consumed. See zfs(8) for a description of the deduplication feature.
prop_delegation=Controls whether a non-privileged user is granted access based on the dataset permissions defined on the dataset. See zfs(8) for more information on ZFS delegated administration.
prop_expandsize=Amount of uninitialized space within the pool or device that can be used to increase the  total  capacity  of  the pool.   Uninitialized  space  consists of any space on an EFI labeled vdev which has not been brought online (i.e. zpool online -e).  This space occurs when a LUN is dynamically expanded.
prop_failmode=Controls the system behavior in the event of catastrophic pool failure. This condition is typically a result of a loss of connectivity to the underlying storage device(s) or a failure of all devices within the pool. The behavior of such an event is determined as follows:<br /> <b>wait</b>      Blocks all I/O access until the device connectivity is recovered and the errors are cleared.  This is the default behavior.<br /><b>continue</b>  Returns EIO to any new write I/O requests but allows reads to any of the remaining healthy devices.  Any write requests that have yet to be committed to disk would be blocked.<br /><b>panic</b>     Prints out a message to the console and generates a system crash dump.
prop_feature@project_quota=GUID org.zfsonlinux:project_quota<br />READ-ONLY COMPATIBLE yes<br />DEPENDENCIES extensible_dataset<br /><br />This feature allows administrators to account the spaces and objects usage information against the project identifier (ID).<br /><br />The project ID is new object-based attribute. When upgrading an existing filesystem, object without project ID attribute will be assigned a zero project ID. After this feature is enabled> parent  inherit flag is set (via chattr +/-P or zfs project [-s|-C]). Otherwise, the new object's project ID will be set as zero. An object's project ID can be changed at anytime by the owner (or privileged user) via chattr -p $prjid or zfs project -p $prjid.<br /><br /> This feature will become active as soon as it is enabled and will never return to being disabled. Each filesystem will  be  upgraded automatically when remounted or when new file is created under that filesystem. The upgrade can also be triggered on filesystems via `zfs set version=current <pool/fs>`.  The upgrade process runs in the background and may take a while to complete for  the  filesystems containing a large number of files.
prop_fragmentation=The amount of fragmentation in the pool.
prop_free=Number of blocks within the pool that are not allocated.
prop_freeing=After a file system or snapshot is destroyed, the space it was using is returned to the pool asynchronously. freeing is the amount of space remaining to be reclaimed. Over time freeing will decrease while free increases.\
prop_guid=A unique identifier for the pool.
prop_health=The current health of the pool. Health can be "ONLINE", "DEGRADED", "FAULTED", "OFFLINE", "REMOVED", or "UNAVAIL".
prop_listsnapshots=Controls whether information about snapshots associated with this pool is output when "zfs list" is run without the -t option. The default value is off.
prop_load_gui=A unique identifier for the pool.  Unlike the guid property, this identifier is generated every time we load the pool (e.g. does not persist across imports/exports) and never changes while the pool is loaded (even if a reguid operation takes place).
prop_multihost=Controls whether a pool activity check should be performed during zpool import.  When a pool is determined to be active it cannot be imported, even with the -f option.  This property is intended to be used in failover configurations where multiple hosts have access to a pool on shared storage.<br /> Multihost provides protection on import only.  It does not protect against an individual device being used in multiple pools, regardless of the type of vdev.  See the discussion under zpool create.<br /> When this property is on, periodic writes to storage occur to show the pool is in use.  See zfs_multihost_interval in the zfs-module-parameters(5) man page.  In order to enable this property each host must set a unique hostid.  See genhostid(1) zgenhostid(8) spl-module-parameters(5) for additional details.  The default value is off.

#snapshot property descriptiosn
prop_defer_destroy=This property is on if the snapshot has been marked for deferred destroy by using the zfs destroy -d command. Otherwise, the property is off.
